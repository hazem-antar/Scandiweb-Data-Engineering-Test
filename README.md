# Data Engineering Test at Scandiweb

The test reired me to analyze all Pokemons and find the best Pokemon ever that was available
in any Pokemon Generation by doing the following steps:

1. Collect information about Pokemons:
Write a script, which will parse this website 
https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pokémon_by_National_Pokédex_number

2. Find the Pokemon which is the most effective companion through all generations
(rank the pokemons from best to worst):
Compare pokemons by using their stats and their types advantages and if
pokemon use more physical or special move types (physical - often are Normal, Fighting, Flying,
Ground, Rock, Bug, Ghost, and Poison, special - Water, Grass, Fire, Ice, Electric, and Psychic).
For example, if Pokemon of Fire type battle with Pokemon of Grass type Fire attack will be
doubled.

3. Create a dashboard according to your vision, adding the rank position using Google Spreadsheets and Google Data Studio
